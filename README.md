Repository for the team project in the course Introduction to Data Science 2019

Analysing the textual metainformation of photographs in Ajapaik - lemmatise the descriptions, create keywords and do named entity recognition based on the descriptions, map the keywords with the ones in Wikidata, compare them to the albums in Ajapaik etc. 
Possibly use descriptions and NER to add location data to the images where it's missing, check whether photos that do have location data are present in the album corresponding to that location etc. 
In addition, for photos with location data, we could look at the users' evaluation of how much a given location has changed over the years (users can give a 3-tier score to the changes: little ... great), this hasn't been researched yet at all.
